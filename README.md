# Dog-Breed-Identification
Dataset comes from Kggle competition, Dog-Breed-Identification  
COMS4995 Deep Learning Final Project  
We test several CNN models, Inception, Xception, VGG, Resnet and Nasnet.
Nasnet achieves the best result, 95% validation accuracy and 0.1583 kaggle score. (without extra dataset)  
If using extra stanford dataset, InceptionV3 + Resnet152 achieves 99.82% validation accuracy and 0.004 kaggle score. (55 out of 1300)
